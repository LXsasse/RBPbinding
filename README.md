# RBP sequence specificity
This folder contains the supplementary code for "Reconstructing the sequence preferences of RNA binding proteins across eukaryotes".

We used derived a linear embedding model to understand the relationship between protein sequence patterns and RNA sequence specificity. 

Dependencies:
python 2.7
scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, statsmodels, seaborn, biopython, etc.

For each figure in the paper, run figX_dependencies.sh before figX.sh

For later figures, some data files from earlier figures might be required and earlier dependencies might need to be run first.
