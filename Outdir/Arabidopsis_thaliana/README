Reconstructed RNA sequence specificities were used to determine potential regulators mRNA stability across plant tissues. Expression of 69 tissues was downloaded from (https://www.arabidopsis.org/).

Specifically, mRNA expression data was retrieved from Klepikova, Anna V., et al. "A high resolution map of the Arabidopsis thaliana developmental transcriptome based on RNA‚Äêseq profiling." The Plant Journal 88.6 (2016): 1058-1070.

Sequencing reads were aligned to whole gene reference sequences with ...

Intron and exon counts were separated and rpkm was calculated for each region. 

Decay rates were determined from exon and intron counts based on protocol shown in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00867-z
